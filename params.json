{"name":"Scaffolder for Laravel","tagline":"Craft your next application easier and faster","body":"Remove the headache of creating over and over again the base code for most of your projects. Scaffolder is tailored following the principle that the development process must be a happy thing so, code and enjoy !\r\nYou are free to extend it the way you need. This package only generate things that you need to start, always keeping the code clean and abstract. Are you hungry ? Fork it !\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Get [laravel](http://laravel.com/docs/5.2#installation) up and running\r\n2. Add the following packages to your composer.json\r\n\r\n    ```json\r\n    ...\r\n    \"laravelcollective/html\": \"5.2.*\",\r\n    \"yajra/laravel-datatables-oracle\": \"~6.0\",\r\n    \"mpaleo/view-tags\": \"dev-master\",\r\n    \"mpaleo/scaffolder-theme-material\": \"dev-master\",\r\n    \"mpaleo/scaffolder\": \"dev-master\",\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n3. Update your packages\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    composer update\r\n    ````\r\n4. Add the service providers to the providers array in `{laravel-root}\\config\\app.php`\r\n\r\n    ```php\r\n    ...\r\n    ViewTags\\ViewTagsServiceProvider::class,\r\n    ScaffolderTheme\\ScaffolderThemeServiceProvider::class,\r\n    Scaffolder\\ScaffolderServiceProvider::class,\r\n    Yajra\\Datatables\\DatatablesServiceProvider::class,\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n5. Add the following aliases in `{laravel-root}\\config\\app.php`\r\n\r\n    ```php\r\n    ...\r\n    'ViewTags'   => ViewTags\\ViewTags::class,\r\n    'Form'       => Collective\\Html\\FormFacade::class,\r\n    'Html'       => Collective\\Html\\HtmlFacade::class,\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nFirst you need to publish the configuration files and assets\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Scaffolder\\ScaffolderServiceProvider\"\r\n./artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"ScaffolderTheme\\ScaffolderThemeServiceProvider\" --force\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are using the theme [mpaleo/scaffolder-theme-material](https://github.com/mpaleo/scaffolder-theme-material), but you can fork it, and do whatever you want/need :)\r\n\r\nAt this point, you already can start to scaffold things. You have two ways to use the package.\r\n\r\n##### Command line way\r\nWhen you execute the artisan publish command, the service provider creates the folder `{laravel-root}\\scaffolder-config` that has the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- scaffolder-config\r\n-- app.json\r\n-- models\r\n-- cache\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `app.json` file contains global settings, also you will get some demo files for models. All you need to scaffold an application is to edit the `app.json` file, and create the json files for the models you want. After you have all the files ready, you have the following commands:\r\n\r\nThis command generate the application using the files that you have provided.\r\n```bash\r\n./artisan scaffolder:generate\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor instance, when you update the package, you should clear the cache files stored in `{laravel-root}\\scaffolder-config\\cache`\r\n```bash\r\n./artisan scaffolder:cache-clear\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### User interface way\r\nAll you need to do, is go to your `http://{crazyhost}/scaffolder/generator` and fill some inputs :)\r\n\r\n##### Next steps\r\nCheck out the [wiki](https://github.com/mpaleo/scaffolder/wiki) to get more information about things that you need to know\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nJust let me know your ideas and let's work together\r\n\r\n### Coding style\r\nIt would be great if we follow the PSR-2 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe scaffolder package is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
